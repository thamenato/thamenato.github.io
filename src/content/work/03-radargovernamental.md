- Designed and implemented a scalable and resilient web crawling system using
  Python, MongoDB and GitLab.

- Automated crawlers for 50 websites to insert and update data in the
  application on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.

- With the system's implementation, time spent on manual data insertion or
  updates was reduced by 50% (from 4 to 2 hours) for each of the 20 employees
  and their focus shifted to validation and analysis instead of data entry.

- Set up monitoring and alerting for web crawlers using Grafana and Prometheus.

- Hosted monitoring system using AWS ECS/EC2 with Terraform.

- Created multiple AWS Lambda services to validate and process data extracted
  from crawlers and insert into database.

- Led the development team of 3, responsible for sprint planning and new hires.
